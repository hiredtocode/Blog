        I could probably use a template and start a blog but I decided to make
        my own from scratch using Gatsby and Material UI.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently I'm using Material UI's components such as the drawer and the
        Appbar but I've learned a lot by implementing these components and
        tweaking them to my needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site is my first website that is built by using Gatsby, Material UI
        and React/JavaScript.
